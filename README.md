## Introduction:
*"In that distant illusory realm, there is a wonderful space called "ShatteredDream". The world here is like a broken mirror, split into three parts: dreams, nightmares and strange dreams."*  
ShatteredDream is a Minecraft mod focused on dimension exploration. Its main features include:
- A sweet dream, like a utopian wonderland, where time seems to stand still forever in this dimension.
- Nightmare, a world of extremes. This place is filled with unspeakable terror and darkness, and the gloomy atmosphere is suffocating. Monsters lurk in every shadow, waiting for their moment to hunt souls.
- Strange dreams are a strange intertwining of dreams and nightmares. In this unpredictable world, you may be wandering in a beautiful garden, and the next moment you fall into a bottomless dark abyss. Every step here is unknown, full of endless possibilities and unpredictable adventures.  
Welcome to "ShatteredDream", a beautiful and weird space, where every dream is waiting for you to explore and discover.
